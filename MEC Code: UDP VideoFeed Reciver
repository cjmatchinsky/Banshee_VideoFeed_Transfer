## Banshee Video Feed (Data Transfer) Code ##

## This code is to access the UDP Socket Server that is hosted on and by the VPS,
## Once the pi and the MEC connect, it will receive frame data from the pi and forward it to the MEC.
## Once the MEC receives the video frame data it will convert it to a usable frame that can be used and viewed by CV2
## For more understanding see the read me file or contact Cameron / Talia.
